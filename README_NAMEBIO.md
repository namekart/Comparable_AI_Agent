# NameBio → Comparable Agent Integration

Ingests historical domain sales from the **NameBio service's sales table** into the
Comparable Agent's vector corpus, so the agent can return real sold-domain
comparables. Designed to scale to **~883k sales (3–4k/day)** without an
unaffordable LLM-per-domain backfill.

---

## 1. The core idea — route computation by information content

A deterministic **rule engine** enriches every domain for free and emits a
**confidence score**. That score (plus sale price and real user demand) decides
which small, high-information subset is worth an expensive LLM call. Every
enrichment is cached **permanently and versioned**, so each expensive
computation happens at most once.

```
                  namebio.namebio_sale  (read-only, same DB)
                                  │  WHERE sale_date = …
                                  ▼
                  map sale_date→date, marketplace→platform
                                  ▼
                  dedupe by DOMAIN (enrich once, reuse for all its sales)
                                  ▼
                       enrichment_cache.get(domain)
                       │ hit → reuse (free)
                       │ miss
                       ▼
         rule_engine.enrich(domain) → category, keywords, tokens, confidence
                                  │
   confidence ≥ 0.75 (HIGH) ──────┤→ enriched_rule          → EMBED NOW
   0.45–0.75    (MEDIUM) ─────────┤→ enriched_rule + queue  → EMBED NOW (lazy LLM upgrade)
   confidence < 0.45  (LOW) ──────┤→ queued_for_llm         → DO NOT embed; queue
   price ≥ $10,000 (PREMIUM) ─────┘→ queued_for_llm         → DO NOT embed; queue
                                  ▼
              EMBED ONLY FINALIZED CONTENT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim)
              composite doc → domain_embeddings (idempotent, chunked, durable)
                                  ▼
                  save ingest cursor (resumable backfill)

  BACKGROUND (non-blocking):  llm_worker drains the queue → LLM enrich
                              → upgrade to enriched_llm → re-embed (version bump)

  QUERY PATH:  a user search enqueues that domain with reason='demand'
               (best-effort; never blocks or breaks a search)
```

**Why "embed only finalized content":** low-confidence rows are *not* embedded
on the rule pass — they're embedded once, after the LLM finishes. This avoids
the wasteful rule→embed→llm→re-embed double cost.

## 2. What gets written where

| System | Role | Access |
|--------|------|--------|
| **`namebio.namebio_sale`** (written by the NameBio service's daily cron, ~08:00) | source of sales | **READ-ONLY** |
| **`comparable.*`** | vector corpus + ingest state | **WRITES** |

Both schemas live in the shared Hetzner Supabase Postgres
(`supabase.h.namekart.com`, Tailscale `100.74.166.27:54322`), created by
[`sql/003_hetzner_shared_db.sql`](sql/003_hetzner_shared_db.sql).

Tables written (see [`sql/001_namebio_integration.sql`](sql/001_namebio_integration.sql)):

- **`domain_enrichment`** — permanent, versioned per-domain enrichment cache
- **`llm_enrichment_queue`** — background LLM work queue (priority-ordered)
- **`ingest_state`** — singleton resumable backfill cursor
- **`domain_embeddings`** — *existing* table; new NameBio rows are tagged
  `metadata.source = 'rule' | 'llm'` (so they're identifiable and removable)

All four live in schema `comparable`. Every connection sets
`search_path = DB_SEARCH_PATH` (`comparable, public`) so unqualified names
resolve there. `domainvaluation1.domain_embeddings` on the same DB is a
different shape — no `content`/`id` — and does not work with this app.

Before 2026-09-23 these tables lived on the name.ai stage Supabase Cloud project
(`mxiwrzfxutzchjlrljxg`, schemas `ai_worker` + `public`), where
[`sql/002_stage_data_fixes.sql`](sql/002_stage_data_fixes.sql) was applied.

## 4. Configuration

All tunables live in [`config.py`](config.py) and are overridable via environment
variables (set these in production — do **not** commit secrets):

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `NAMEBIO_SALES_TABLE` | `namebio.namebio_sale` | NameBio's sales table (read-only) |
| `DAILY_INGEST_CRON` | `0 9 * * *` | in-app daily ingest schedule (UTC); empty disables it — set empty for a local API pointed at the production DB |
| `DOMAIN_EMBEDDINGS_TABLE` | `domain_embeddings` | vector table used by **both** search and ingest |
| `DB_SEARCH_PATH` | `comparable, public` | set on every connection (needs a session-level connection, e.g. direct Postgres) |
| `SUPABASE_HOST` / `SUPABASE_PORT` | — / `5432` | Hetzner: `100.74.166.27` / `54322` (direct Postgres over Tailscale) |
| `HIGH_CONFIDENCE` / `MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE` / `LOW_CONFIDENCE` | `0.75` / `0.45` / `0.20` | routing bands |
| `PREMIUM_PRICE_THRESHOLD` | `10000` | sale price forcing LLM enrichment |
| `EMBED_BATCH_SIZE` | `256` | embed/flush chunk size (durability) |
| `CURRENT_ENRICHMENT_VERSION` / `CURRENT_EMBEDDING_VERSION` | `1` / `1` | bump to selectively refresh stale rows |
| `SUPABASE_*` | — | existing DB credentials |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` / `LLM_API_KEY` | OpenRouter / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint and key for domain descriptions (worker and query-time enrichment) |
| `LLM_MODEL` | `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` | model id at that endpoint (prod: CodeCraft `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`, ~$0.0002/domain, no daily cap; OpenRouter `:free` models stop at 1,000 requests/day) |
| `DAILY_LLM_WORKERS` | `12` | parallel LLM workers the daily ingest runs right after ingesting; 0 disables |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | — | LLM key when `LLM_API_KEY` is not set |

> **Versioning:** to refresh enrichments after improving the rule engine, bump
> `CURRENT_ENRICHMENT_VERSION` and re-run — only rows with
> `enrichment_version < CURRENT` are reprocessed. No full rebuild.

---

## 5. Setup

```bash
# 1. Python 3.11 venv (matches production; torch==2.1.2 has no 3.12+ build)
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # Windows PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 2. Apply the DB migration (Supabase SQL editor / psql / the one-liner below)
python -c "from src.enrichment.namebio import db; \
  sql=open('sql/001_namebio_integration.sql',encoding='utf-8').read(); \
  c=db.connect(); cur=c.cursor(); cur.execute(sql); c.commit(); print('migration applied')"

# 3. Set env (.env locally, Coolify in prod). Minimum:
#    SUPABASE_HOST/PORT/DB/USER/PASSWORD, OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
#    DB_SEARCH_PATH=comparable,public, DOMAIN_EMBEDDINGS_TABLE=domain_embeddings
```

---

## 6. Running

```bash
# One-time historical backfill (resumable — safe to stop/restart):
python -m src.enrichment.namebio.ingest --backfill --from 2024-01-01 --to 2026-06-18

# Daily incremental: runs automatically inside the API process at
# DAILY_INGEST_CRON (09:00 UTC, an hour after NameBio's 08:00 fetch) — see
# src/enrichment/namebio/scheduler.py. It catches up days missed while the app
# was down (up to 7) and waits for days NameBio hasn't written yet.
# Manual equivalent for one day:
python -m src.enrichment.namebio.ingest --daily

# Background LLM worker — drains the queue (LLM enrich + re-embed):
python -m src.enrichment.namebio.llm_worker            # drain until empty
python -m src.enrichment.namebio.llm_worker --max 50   # cap (good for cost control)
python -m src.enrichment.namebio.llm_worker --workers 16 --min-priority 25   # parallel, $5k+ tier only

# Queue every domain with a sale >= $5k that has no vector yet for LLM descriptions
# (domains that already have vectors are skipped, never replaced):
python -m src.enrichment.namebio.ingest --enqueue-tier --min-price 5000
```

The backfill is **idempotent** (re-running skips already-enriched domains) and
**resumable** (cursor in `ingest_state`; a crash loses at most one date).

---

## 7. Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v        # 31 tests, all mocked (no live DB/API needed)
```

Covers: rule-engine confidence routing, NameBio client field-mapping/pagination/
retry, ingest dedupe + embed-only-finalized + routing, and cache versioning.

---

## 8. Observability / health

```bash
# Enrichment status distribution:
SELECT status, count(*) FROM domain_enrichment GROUP BY status;

# Queue backlog:
SELECT queue_reason, status, count(*) FROM llm_enrichment_queue GROUP BY 1,2;

# NameBio rows now in the corpus:
SELECT count(*) FROM domain_embeddings WHERE metadata->>'source' IN ('rule','llm');

# Backfill progress:
SELECT * FROM ingest_state;
```

---

## 9. Production checklist (before go-live)

- [ ] **Set a real LLM model** in `config.py` — `openai/gpt-5.1` is **not a valid
      model id**. Use a real OpenRouter model (e.g. a current GPT-4o-mini /
      Claude Haiku class model for cheap structured JSON).
- [ ] **Funded OpenRouter key** — the prior prod key was *limit-exceeded* (403).
- [ ] **Rotate any key shared during development** — treat as compromised.
- [ ] **Apply `sql/001_namebio_integration.sql`** to the production Supabase.
- [ ] Confirm `DOMAIN_EMBEDDINGS_TABLE` resolves correctly in prod.
- [ ] Decide whether to keep the ~250 NameBio rows already ingested during
      testing, or purge with:
      `DELETE FROM domain_embeddings WHERE metadata->>'source' IN ('rule','llm');`
- [ ] Do **not** commit `.venv/` or `.env` (both gitignored).

---

## 10. Cost note

Embeddings are **local and free** (sentence-transformers). LLM cost applies
**only** to queued domains (low-confidence / premium / demand) — the rule path
covers the bulk for free, and every LLM result is cached forever. Cap the worker
with `--max` to control spend.

## 11. Known characteristics

- Rule-enriched domains have terse descriptions, so they retrieve with shorter
  semantic reach than existing LLM-rich rows. This is by design — the queue
  upgrades the domains that matter (low-confidence/premium/searched) to rich LLM
  descriptions. Run the `llm_worker` to close that gap over time.
- The demand hook in `retrieve_node` is best-effort and silently no-ops if the
  DB is unreachable — it never affects a live search.
