"""
Deterministic rule-based domain enrichment (the information-theory router).

Given a domain, produce a category classification, keywords, normalized
tokens, a short description, and a CONFIDENCE score in [0, 1]. The confidence
is what routes computation downstream:

    >= HIGH_CONFIDENCE   -> meaning is obvious; accept rule result (free)
    MEDIUM .. HIGH       -> accept but flag for lazy LLM upgrade
    <  MEDIUM            -> meaning is ambiguous/coined; queue for LLM

The guiding idea: low-information, obvious names (mortgagebroker.com,
cryptoexchange.ai) are cheap to classify deterministically and get high
confidence. High-information, non-obvious coined names (zyro.ai, vanta.ai)
score low and are deferred to the LLM, where the expensive call is justified.

Pure module: no network, no DB, no LLM. Categories map onto the agent's
fixed list in config.DOMAIN_CATEGORIES so they stay compatible with
scoring.compute_category_match.
